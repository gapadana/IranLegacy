## What is it?
A simple engine start-stop system. If your car (only enabled for cars) is stopped for 4 seconds, the engine will automatically disable itself. As soon as you hit the brakes/reverse or hit the accelerator controls the engine will be turned on and you can drive away with minimal delay.

## Config options:
These config options can be changed in the `startstopclient.lua` file at the very top.

|option|default value|description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`delay`|`4000`|Configure the amount of time it takes for your engine to be killed when your vehicle is stopped. Default 4 seconds.|
|`toggleCommand`|`"ss"`|The command to enable/disable the start-stop system in case you don't want it enabled. When toggling the start stop system using this command, the user preference is saved to the client, so next time the user joins, their last saved setting will be used so they don't have to constantly toggle it on/off once they (re)join.|
|`sendChatMessage`|`true`|When true it'll send a chat message indicating the new state when the toggle command is used.|
|`sendNotification`|`true`|Sends a notification above the minimap whenever the toggle command is used. It's recommended to either enable this or the chat message, don't enable both, that's just silly.|
